GAPS stands for Goals, Analyses, Plans, and Statuses. It’s a structured method for clarifying problems and solutions by sorting your thoughts into these four categories.

- **Goals:**  
  What you want to achieve. Desired outcomes, targets, or objectives.

- **Statuses:**  
  What’s happening now. The current situation, facts, or observations.

- **Analyses:**  
  Why the gap exists. Causes, contributing factors, or insights about why things aren’t as desired.

- **Plans:**  
  How to move forward. Actions, strategies, or next steps to close the gap.

## 4. How the Quadrants Work Together

The GAPS process helps you clarify your situation by breaking it down into:
- **Goals:** Where you want to go

- **Plans:** How to get from here to there
